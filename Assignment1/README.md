# Report for Homework1 of CS6650

## Server

I implemented a full-completed server which can handle every request and return response as https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/cloud-perf/SkiDataAPI/1.16#/skiers/getSkierResortTotals expected.

## Client Overview

### Design

<img src="/Users/jeromy/Desktop/CS6650/Assignment1/Clients/client1.png" alt="client1" style="zoom:50%;" />

Client 1 is consist of three parts:

The first part is global arguments processing, where I utilized `args4j` to parse the arguments. I also stored the global variables like `successCount`, `failureCount` which represents the total number of successful and failed requests.

The second part is a runnable class `PhaseThread`, which accepts `int startID, int endID, int startTime, int endTime, int numOfReqs, CountDownLatch latch` as parameter, this is the per client request model.

The third part is main class `client` which has a `static void main` function. This class firstly load the arguments from `Argument` then create a thread pool with total numbers of three phases. All the staticstics data are calculated here.

In addition to Client 1, Client 2 also contains a `csvUtiliizer` class to utilize the data.

</center>

The above results are generated by `-nt 32 -ns 2000 -nl 40 -nr 10 -test-only -server ec2-54-149-212-65.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` arguments with `-test-only` enabled or disabled. The test only data is calculated by test same number of threads 

We can see the predicted throughput for test-only is $\frac{8 + 32 + 3}{58.4585} \approx \frac{16003}{55928} = 0.286$,  especially consider three phases of clients using different number of threads.

The above charts and results are did by `-nt 32 -ns 2000 -nl 40 -nr 10 -server ec2-54-149-212-65.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` with `nt` changes to `32/64/128/256` respectively.
